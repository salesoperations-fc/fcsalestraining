   Same question types and scoring as exam 1 (see product-knowledge-1-questions.js):
     single / tf: 1 point. multi (tick all): 0.5 for each right item ticked, minus 0.5 for each wrong item ticked (never below 0),
     so the question is worth 0.5 x the number of right items. answer = index (single/tf) or array of indices (multi).
