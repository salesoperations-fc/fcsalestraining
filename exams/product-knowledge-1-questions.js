     tf      True/False, answer = 0 (True) or 1 (False); not shuffled
     text    typed answer. fmt:"peso" shows a ₱ sign and commas as you type; fmt:"plain" is digits only. answer = the digits to match (e.g. "199500" accepts P199,500 / 199500 / ₱199,500)

      questions: [
        { type:"single", q:"What's a revolving credit line?", options:[
            "A one-time loan where you borrow a fixed amount and repay it in equal installments.",
            "A credit facility that lets businesses borrow, repay, and borrow again up to a set limit, as long as they repay on time.",
            "A one-time short-term loan where only interest is paid monthly, and the principal is due at the end of the term."], answer:1,
          why:"A revolving credit line (like First Circle's BCL) lets SMEs withdraw, repay, and withdraw again up to their approved limit, similar to a credit card but designed for businesses. Term loans are usually one-time." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client got granted a credit limit with a 0.79% interest rate. They want to do a bi-weekly (2x a month) repayment scheme. What would be their new monthly interest rate?", options:["0.69%","0.79%","1.99%"], answer:1,
          why:"The rate stays at 0.79%. Choosing a bi-weekly repayment scheme doesn't change the monthly interest rate." },
        { type:"text", q:"What is the annual subscription fee of a ₱5,000,000 revolving credit line? Type the amount in pesos (ex: ₱87,500)", answer:"199500", fmt:"peso",
          why:"The annual subscription fee of a ₱5,000,000 line is P199,500." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client just got granted a credit line and wants to drawdown. You need to ask them what's their preferred convenience fee. What's the best pitch to them knowing they only want to utilize their credit line once a year?", options:[
            "\"I recommend the annual subscription fee as it's the cheaper option vs. the processing fee if you only plan on using it once a year.\"",
            "\"I recommend the processing fee since a one-time fee due 10 days after your drawdown will make it easier to repay.\"",
            "\"I recommend the processing fee as it's the cheaper option vs. the subscription fee if you only plan on using it once a year.\""], answer:2,
          why:"If the borrower only wants to use the line once or twice a year, the processing fee saves them more. If they plan to use it more than 3 times a year, the subscription fee saves more." },
        { type:"single", q:"When is a client eligible for an interest discount?", options:[
            "1 month after disbursement of their first loan.","1 month after their credit line gets approved.","2 months after their credit line gets approved."], answer:2,
          why:"A client is only eligible for a discount 2 months after the credit line gets approved." },
        { type:"single", q:"What's the maximum term of First Circle's credit line?", options:["12 months","24 months","There is no maximum term, only a minimum term."], answer:1,
          why:"The longest term is 24 months, under the Business Credit Plus." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client wants to use their BCL. They want a 4-month term loan but only wants to pay the entire principal and interest at the end of the loan (which is the end of the 4th month). Is this possible?", options:[
            "Yes, it's possible since there's an option for bullet repayment, where clients can withhold paying anything for at most 4 months.",
            "No, it's not possible because bullet repayment only extends 3 months max.",
            "No, you can only repay First Circle either every 2 weeks or every month. It's not possible to withhold payments past 1 month."], answer:1,
          why:"Bullet repayment is only 3 months max. It can't go past 3." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client is granted a P5M credit line with a rate of 1.39%. They asked you they want to use their credit line but would like to do a bullet repayment. What would be the updated interest rate?", options:[
            "There's an additional 1%, where the new rate is 2.39%.",
            "There's a 1% discount since they'll repay in one go. So the new rate is 0.39%.",
            "Rate remains the same at 1.39%. There's no discount or additional rate."], answer:0,
          why:"Bullet repayment adds 1% to the monthly interest rate because it's riskier for us: we receive nothing until the end of the loan term." },
        { type:"single", q:"Which type of credit line enables you to do a 1-month only term with an all-in-1 fee?", options:["Business Credit Line","Business Credit Plus","Express Business Loan"], answer:2,
          why:"The Express Business Loan gives a 1-month term with an all-in-1 price." },
        { type:"single", q:"If the annual revenue of a business is around P62M, what would be the estimated credit line value?", options:["P10M","P5M","P6M"], answer:1,
          why:"The estimated credit line is P5M. Note that it's only an estimate, not the actual value." },
        { type:"tf", q:"Your client got granted a P7.5M credit line. They used P5.5M of their line. Based on the principal paydown policy, is their credit limit locked?", options:["Yes","No"], answer:1,
          why:"Not locked yet. Utilization is about 73% (P5.5M of P7.5M), below the 75% mark." },
        { type:"single", q:"It's 2 days before the due date of the client's loan. Can they still reschedule?", options:[
            "Yes, since we can accommodate up until 1 day before the due date.",
            "Yes, since we can accommodate up until 2 days before the due date.",
            "No, since we can only accommodate up until 3 days before the due date."], answer:1,
          why:"We can reschedule loans up to 2 days before the due date. Anything later, we can't." },
        { type:"single", q:"You're at a medical and health convention. You get to speak with a start-up founder who sells glucose meters (a device used to measure blood sugar) through his physical store in Robinsons Cainta. He's only been operating for 3 months and only sells direct-to-consumer, but already has ₱30M in sales. Are they qualified for First Circle's revolving credit line?", options:[
            "It depends on whether the business is a corp or a sole prop.",
            "Yes, as he's already reached more than ₱25M in revenue!",
            "No, since B2C businesses need to be operating for more than 1 year."], answer:2,
          why:"B2C businesses need to have been operating for more than 1 year." },
        { type:"single", q:"Can clients submit paid invoices as proof of future revenue?", options:[
            "Yes, so long as the invoices are signed by their client.",
            "No, they can submit fulfilled purchase orders instead.",
            "No, paid invoices aren't valid since they've been paid already."], answer:2,
          why:"Paid invoices aren't valid because they've already been paid. They are no longer proof of future income." },

        { type:"single", q:"How can batch transfers help with payroll?", options:[
