/* Product Knowledge Exam 3 (Day 5). Edit the questions here; the page is exams/product-knowledge-3.html.
   Same question types and scoring as exams 1 and 2 (see product-knowledge-1-questions.js):
     single / tf: 1 point. multi (tick all): 0.5 for each right item ticked, minus 0.5 for each wrong item ticked (never below 0),
     so the question is worth 0.5 x the number of right items. answer = index (single/tf) or array of indices (multi).
   why = the feedback shown after the exam. whyWrong (optional) = shown instead of why when the answer is wrong.
   Source: the Google Form "Product Knowledge Examination Part 3" and its answer key. The form did not list the wrong choices for most
   questions, so those wrong choices were written to match (marked "check" in the notes of the chat that added this file). */

      questions: [
        { type:"single", q:"What's a short-term loan?", options:[
            "Loans that are repaid within a short period, usually 6 to 12 months.",
            "Loans that are repaid over a long period, usually 3 to 5 years.",
            "Loans that only need to be repaid once the business makes a profit."], answer:0,
          why:"You're right! Short-term loans are repaid within a short period, usually 6 to 12 months." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client got granted a credit limit with a 1.99% interest rate. They want to do a bi-weekly (2x a month) repayment scheme. What would be their new monthly interest rate?", options:["1.89%","1.99%","1.79%"], answer:0,
          why:"Correct! 1.89% is the new interest rate since we give 0.1% discount since we get the payment faster." },
        { type:"single", q:"What is the processing fee of a ₱25,000,000 revolving credit line?", options:["₱497,500","₱250,000","Not Applicable"], answer:2,
          why:"Correct! 25M Credit Limit falls under Medium+ tier and the maximum we can offer, hence the processing fee is waived." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client just got granted a credit line and wants to drawdown. You need to ask them what's their preferred convenience fee. What's the best pitch to them knowing they want to utilise their credit line more than 3-4 times a year?", options:[
            "\"I recommend the annual subscription fee as it's the cheaper option vs. the processing fee if you only plan on using it once a year.\"",
            "\"I recommend the processing fee since a one-time fee due 10 days after your drawdown will make it easier to repay.\"",
            "\"I recommend the processing fee as it's the cheaper option vs. the subscription fee if you only plan on using it once a year.\""], answer:0,
          why:"Correct! Its best to recommend in this scenario that Annual Subscription Fee if they are sure to use it 3-4 times a year since its cheaper than opting for processing fee." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client got approved at 0.99% Medium+ segment. They want to request a discount on their interest rate. Would they be eligible?", options:["Yes after 2 months","No","Yes after 1 month"], answer:1,

            "Yes, since we have Express Business Loan",
            "No, a term loan always needs monthly repayments",
            "Yes, but only if the term is at least 3 months"], answer:0,
          why:"Nice one! 1 month loan term is automatically for EBL." },
        { type:"single", q:"Your client is granted a P5M credit line with a rate of 0.99%. They asked you they want to use their credit line but would like to do a bullet repayment. What would be the updated interest rate?", options:[
            "There's an additional 1%, where the new rate is 1.99%.",
            "There's an additional 1%, where the new rate is 1.49%.",
            "Rate remains the same at 0.99%. There's no discount or additional rate."], answer:0,
          why:"Yeahh, there's an additional 1% to the monthly interest rate if the client avails of a bullet repayment because it's riskier for us. Imagine, we're not getting any money up until the end of the loan term." },
        { type:"single", q:"Which type of credit line will the client choose if they are planning to repay for 1 month?", options:["Business Credit Line","Business Credit Plus","Express Business Loan"], answer:2,

          why:"Correct! Estimated value of the credit line is P6M even though its beyond 92M since the max base for Sole Prop is at P6M only. However, do note that it's only estimated and not the actual value." },
        { type:"tf", q:"Your client got granted a P6M credit line. They used P5M of their line. Based on the principal paydown policy, is their credit limit locked?", options:["Yes","No"], answer:0,
